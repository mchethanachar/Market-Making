This project simulates market making using historical order flow data from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). It involves:

1. Reading historical order flow from a CSV file, specifically data from the BSE (October 2023).
2. Implementing the exchange's matching algorithm to accurately reconstruct the Limit Order Book (LOB) as maintained by BSE.
3. Utilizing this LOB to analyze and develop efficient market-making strategies.

The current market-making model is based on a straightforward Order Book weight difference. I'm actively exploring academic papers and books, particularly Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading by √Ålvaro Cartea and colleagues, to enhance and refine this approach.
